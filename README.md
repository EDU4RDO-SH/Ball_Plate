###Description##
This is the ball and plate balancing system code.  This is to be compiled on the BeagleBoard XM and used with a bluetooth dongle (for wiimote access), Pololu Micro Maestro (for servo control) and the touch screen attached to the USB ports.  This code forms part of my final year project for the course Engineering Design 4 at RMIT.

###Usage###
1. Compile code by typing "make" in the root directory
2. run program by typeing ./ball_plate in the root directory
3. To make program run automatically on system startup type "sudo make startup"
4. To remove program from startup type "sudo make not_startup"
